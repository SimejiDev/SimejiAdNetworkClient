# Banner Ads

## Prerequisites
Import the SAN Mobile Ads SDK, Please read the doc `san_sdk_get_started_ios.pdf` first

## Always test with test ads
- When building and testing your apps, make sure you use test ads rather than live, production ads. Failure to do so can lead to suspension of your account.

- The easiest way to load test ads is to use our dedicated test ad unit ID for iOS banners:
    > `pid_demo-1000011_1001`  

    you're free to use it in your own apps while coding, testing, and debugging. Just make sure you replace it with your own ad unit ID before publishing your app.

## Create a SANBannerView
Banner ads are displayed in `SANBannerView` objects, so the first step toward integrating banner ads is to include a `SANBannerView` in your view hierarchy. This is typically done either with the Interface Builder or programmatically.

### Interface Builder
A `SANBannerView` can be added to a storyboard or xib file like any typical view. When using this method, be sure to add width and height constraints to match the ad size you'd like to display. For example, when displaying a banner (320x50), use a width constraint of 320 points, and a height constraint of 50 points.

### Programmatically
A `SANBannerView` can also be instantiated directly. Here's an example of how to create a `SANBannerView`, aligned to the bottom center of the safe area of the screen, with a banner size of 320x50:
```objc
@import SANMobileAds;

@interface ViewController ()

@property(nonatomic, strong) SANBannerView *bannerView;

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];
  
  // In this case, we instantiate the banner with desired ad size.
  self.bannerView = [[SANBannerView alloc] initWithAdSize:SANAdSizeBanner];

  [self addBannerViewToView:self.bannerView];
}

- (void)addBannerViewToView:(UIView *)bannerView {
  bannerView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
  [self.view addSubview:bannerView];
  [self.view addConstraints:@[
    [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:bannerView
                               attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom
                               relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
                                  toItem:self.bottomLayoutGuide
                               attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTop
                              multiplier:1
                                constant:0],
    [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:bannerView
                               attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX
                               relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
                                  toItem:self.view
                               attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX
                              multiplier:1
                                constant:0]
                                ]];
}

@end
```
## Configure SANBannerView properties
In order to load and display ads, `SANBannerView `requires a few properties be set.

- `rootViewController` - This view controller is used to present an overlay when the ad is clicked. It should normally be set to the view controller that contains the `SANBannerView`.
- adUnitID - This is the ad unit ID from which the `SANBannerView` should load ads.

Here's a code example showing how to set the two required properties in the `viewDidLoad` method of a UIViewController:
```objc
- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];
  ...

  self.bannerView.adUnitID = @"pid_demo-1000011_1001";
  self.bannerView.rootViewController = self;
}
```

## Load an ad
Once the `SANBannerView` is in place and its properties configured, it's time to load an ad. This is done by calling `loadRequest`: on a `SANRequest` object:
```objc
- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];
  ...

  self.bannerView.adUnitID = @"pid_demo-1000011_1001";
  self.bannerView.rootViewController = self;
  [self.bannerView loadRequest:[SANRequest request]];
}
```
## Ad events
Through the use of `SANBannerViewDelegate`, you can listen for lifecycle events, such as when an ad is closed or the user leaves the app.

### Registering for banner events
To register for banner ad events, set the delegate property on `SANBannerView` to an object that implements the `SANBannerViewDelegate` protocol. Generally, the class that implements banner ads also acts as the delegate class, in which case, the delegate property can be set to self.
```objc
@import GoogleMobileAds;

@interface ViewController () <SANBannerViewDelegate>

@property(nonatomic, strong) SANBannerView *bannerView;

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];
  ...
  self.bannerView.delegate = self;
}
```
### Implementing banner events
Each of the methods in `SANBannerViewDelegate` is marked as optional, so you only need to implement the methods you want. This example implements each method and logs a message to the console:
```objc
- (void)bannerViewDidReceiveAd:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  NSLog(@"bannerViewDidReceiveAd");
}

- (void)bannerView:(SANBannerView *)bannerView didFailToReceiveAdWithError:(NSError *)error {
  NSLog(@"bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
}

- (void)bannerViewDidRecordImpression:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  NSLog(@"bannerViewDidRecordImpression");
}

- (void)bannerViewWillPresentScreen:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  NSLog(@"bannerViewWillPresentScreen");
}

- (void)bannerViewWillDismissScreen:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  NSLog(@"bannerViewWillDismissScreen");
}

- (void)bannerViewDidDismissScreen:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  NSLog(@"bannerViewDidDismissScreen");
}
```
### Use cases
Here are some example use cases for these ad event methods.

**Adding a banner to the view hierarchy once an ad is received**

You may want to delay in adding a `SANBannerView` to the view hierarchy until after an ad is received. You can do this by listening for the `bannerViewDidReceiveAd`: event:
```objc
- (void)bannerViewDidReceiveAd:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  // Add bannerView to view and add constraints as above.
  [self addBannerViewToView:self.bannerView];
}
```
**Animating a banner ad**

You can also use the `bannerViewDidReceiveAd`: event to animate a banner ad once it's returned, as shown in the following example:
```objc
- (void)bannerViewDidReceiveAd:(SANBannerView *)bannerView {
  bannerView.alpha = 0;
  [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^{
    bannerView.alpha = 1;
  }];
}
```
